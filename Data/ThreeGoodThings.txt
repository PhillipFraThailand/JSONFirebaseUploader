    title s = THREE GOOD THINGS
    categoryTitle s = Positive Emotions

    purpose s = Our brain is wired to primarily focus on and pay attention to all the things that could be perceived as dangerous or a threat to our survival. This is called negativity bias and entails that negative thoughts and emotions takes up more of our attention than the positive. In our day-to-day lives, it's easy to get caught up in the things that go wrong and feel like we're living under our own private rain cloud; at the same time, we tend to adapt to the good things and people in our lives, taking them for granted. Although emotions like disappointment are natural and serve an important purpose, it can be draining to focus all our attention on them. Research has shown that we can train our ability to focus on positive events, that leads to positive emotions. By doing so, we cultivate positive emotions and become more resilient.
